Lots of copying and pasting just to document.

To start a new Create React App project with TypeScript, you can run:
```
npx create-react-app chakra --template typescript
```

Inside your CRA project directory, install Chakra UI by running either of the following:
```
npm i @saas-ui/react @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
```

After installing Saas UI and Chakra UI, you need to set up the SaasProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx or index.tsx
